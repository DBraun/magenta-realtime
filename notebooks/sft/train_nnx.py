# # SFT Training (NNX) — POC
#
# Proof-of-concept supervised fine-tuning of the Magenta-RT V2 depthformer
# in `flax.nnx`. Pipeline:
#
# 1. `magenta_rt.sft.create_audiotree_dataset(...)` — `grain` pipeline of pure-numpy
#    AudioTree transforms (random crop, MusicCoCa sticky repeat, CFG dropout)
#    yielding batched AudioTrees; `to_source_target(...)` builds source/target at
#    the trainer boundary (encoding audio->tokens on device when needed).
# 2. Model: `EncoderDecoder.from_config(spec)` (random weights by default;
#    pass `--checkpoint` to load pretrained Linen safetensors).
# 3. Encoder freeze via `nnx.Param` → `Frozen` Variable retype, so
#    `nnx.Optimizer(model, tx, wrt=nnx.Param)` and
#    `nnx.value_and_grad(..., argnums=nnx.DiffState(0, nnx.Param))` both skip
#    encoder state entirely.
# 4. Loss: cross-entropy over `[B, T, Q, V]` logits.
# 5. Checkpointing via `orbax.checkpoint.CheckpointManager` (async + best-key;
#    adapter-only model state when LoRA is active).
# 6. Metric logging via `clu.metric_writers` + `periodic_actions.ReportProgress`.

    Generating audio needs the SpectroStream codec and the depthformer's

    changing the graphdef the functional train step captured (and its
    constant/mutable split). So this keeps a **separate sampler**: a full
    ``MagentaRT2Sampler`` (depthformer +
    codec) built lazily from the same preset/checkpoint, mirrored with
    the run's LoRA structure, whose *trainable* state is synced from the
    training model right before each sample (adapter-only in LoRA mode —
    KBs; the trainable ``nnx.Param`` set in full-SFT mode). Training is
    never touched.

    Conditioning comes from a held-out batch of the run's own prepared
    source tokens, so the sample shows what the model does on
    training-like conditioning. Cost: a second model instance in memory —
    only paid when ``config.sample_every_steps > 0`` and the run has a
    real preset + checkpoint (the tiny POC has no codec weights).
